## Requirements

This projects rely on the [GalFlow](https://github.com/DifferentiableUniverseInitiative/GalFlow) library as well as
[GalSim](https://github.com/GalSim-developers/GalSim). To install these requirements:
```bash
$ pip install git+https://github.com/DifferentiableUniverseInitiative/GalFlow.git
```
And we are also assuming that TensorFlow is installed.
